a mighty monarch in the days of old
made offer of high honour, wealth and gold,
to one who should produce in form concise
a motto for his guidance, terse yet wise

a precept, soothing in his hours forlorn
yet one that in his prosperous days would warn
many the maxims sent the king, men say
the one he chose: "this too shall pass away".
